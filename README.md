This is a simple program for a Telegram Bot that allows it to receive images and send them back blurred, even forwarded images (which is a functionality still missing in Telegram).

I did it as I was tired of downloading the images I wanted to send back blurred.

Remember to change the placeholder names, otherwise the progam won't work.
